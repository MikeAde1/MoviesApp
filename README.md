# MoviesApp

This is a simple application that fetches a list of movies and displays more details about those movies using the [moviedb API](https://www.themoviedb.org/).

## Technologies

The project is split into 3 major layers - the data, domain and UI layers. It makes use of the following technologies to achieve clean architecture: `Kotlin`, `Jetpack Compose`, `Room`, `RxJava`, `Hilt`, `JUnit`, `Mockito` and `Retrofit`. Continuous Integration was added using [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).
